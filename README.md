         "env": {
            "NODE_ENV": "development" // Set environment variables here
         },
         "sourceMaps": true, // Enable source maps if using transpilation
         "restart": true, // Automatically restart if changes are detected
         "runtimeExecutable": null, // Use the default Node.js runtime
         "args": ["--inspect"] // Additional arguments to pass to Node.js
      }
   ]
}

**Step 2: Use the Launch Configuration**

1. Open the Command Palette and type "Debug: Start Debugging".
